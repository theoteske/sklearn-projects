# sklearn-projects
I use this repository for nicely written-up Jupyter notebooks using the scikit-learn library. I just finished a project predicting the fares of Uber rides which involved a large (200k instances) real-world dataset. Other than that, the notebooks here are for educational purposes, so if you'd like to learn how to use sklearn for machine learning, feel free to check them out.
